# OpsGuide RAG Architecture

## Overview

OpsGuide is a **RAG-powered operational intelligence system** that transforms operational challenges into actionable intelligence through **vector search, knowledge retrieval, and LLM reasoning** (when budget or security approvals permit). Built with a dual-mode architecture for cost-conscious deployment that delivers citation-backed responses grounded in your actual documentation.

## System Architecture
**Opsguide** uses the same architectural pattern as ChatGpt when searching requires web page search

**Retrieval**: When you ask ChatGPT a question that requires current or factual information (e.g., "What were the key highlights of the latest tech conference?"), it doesn't just rely on its pre-trained knowledge. It uses a built-in search tool (powered by Bing) to actively retrieve relevant and up-to-date information from the web.

**Augmentation**: The data it retrieves from the search results is then "augmented" or added to the prompt. This provides the model with new context and external facts.

**Generation**: With this augmented context, the model then generates a response. Because it's "grounded" in the information from the web, the response is more accurate, less prone to hallucination, and includes citations to the original sources.

While RAG systems like ChatGPT and Claude handle the retrieval and generation of content, a tool like Cursor AI goes a step further by also handling the execution.

The two-part process for an Agent or Autonomous system:

**Planning (The RAG Part)**: When you give Cursor a high-level command (e.g., "Build a full-stack user authentication system"), it doesn't immediately start writing code. First, it acts like a RAG system. It retrieves information from its own knowledge base, your codebase, and potentially external documentation. It uses this context to generate a detailed, step-by-step execution plan. This plan outlines which files to create, which functions to write, and how to connect everything.

**Execution**: Once the plan is generated and, in many workflows, approved by the user, Cursor's "Agent" or "Executor" mode takes over. It uses the plan as its guide and actively carries out the tasks. This means it can:
- Create and modify files on your local machine.
- Write code based on the plan.
- Run terminal commands to install dependencies, run tests, or debug the code.
- Commit changes to your Git repository.

This is a form of agentic behavior, which Opsguide can be extended to , to achieve behvior of a full autonomous system.

## 🎯 Core Use Cases

### 1. **🚨 Incident → Next Steps**
**Transform alerts into safe actions through complete RAG pipeline**
- **Input**: Alert payloads (ServiceNow/Datadog), log snippets, service errors
- **RAG Retrieval**: Vector search through runbooks, postmortems, API specs, previous incidents
- **LLM Reasoning**: Contextual analysis with retrieved documentation for precise diagnosis
- **Output**: Ranked hypotheses + citation-backed safe next actions

**RAG Flow Example**: *"System unable to ship an order (400 Bad Request)"*
1. **Retrieval**: Vector search finds "Shipping reconciliation runbook v3", downstream API specs
2. **Augmentation**: Business rules applied (API-over-DB preference), risk assessment
3. **Generation**: LLM reasons with context → "Shipping validation failed. Execute reconciliation via `/v2/orders/{id}/reconcile` API per runbook v3"

### 2. **🔧 Operational Ask → Safe Procedures**
**Convert natural language requests into API-first procedures with LLM reasoning**
- **Input**: Natural language operational requests ("cancel order", "change status")
- **RAG Retrieval**: Specific API documentation, safety procedures, approval workflows
- **LLM Reasoning**: Apply business rules (API-over-DB principle) with actual endpoint specifications
- **Output**: Step-by-step procedures with safety checks and rollback plans

**RAG Flow Example**: *"Business wants to cancel order fully"*
1. **Retrieval**: Cancellation API documentation, business rules, approval matrix
2. **Augmentation**: Risk assessment, environment context, user permissions
3. **Generation**: LLM generates → "Execute cancellation via `/v2/orders/{id}/cancel` with validation checks per policy v2.1"

### 3. **📚 Business Query → System Explanation**
**Transform questions into comprehensive system understanding through multi-source synthesis**
- **Input**: Business questions ("How does Payments and Charges work?")
- **RAG Retrieval**: Vector search across design docs, PRDs, runbooks, code repositories
- **LLM Reasoning**: Synthesize multi-source documentation into coherent explanations
- **Output**: Comprehensive workflow explanations with source citations

**RAG Flow Example**: *"How does Payments and Charges work?"*
1. **Retrieval**: Design docs, API specs, workflow diagrams, code comments
2. **Augmentation**: Context enrichment with service dependencies, business rules
3. **Generation**: LLM synthesizes → Complete payment workflow explanation with step-by-step process and system interactions

## 🧠 Complete RAG Pipeline (When Enabled)

### **Phase 1: Retrieval - Vector Knowledge Search**
```python
# Step 1: Embed user query using Bedrock Titan
query_embedding = bedrock_titan.embed_query(user_query)

# Step 2: Vector search across knowledge base
relevant_chunks = opensearch.vector_search(
    query_embedding, 
    indices=['runbooks', 'postmortems', 'design_docs', 'api_specs', 'code'],
    top_k=5,
    filters={'environment': target_env, 'service': service_context}
)

# Step 3: Rank and filter retrieved chunks
filtered_knowledge = knowledge_ranker.rank_by_relevance(
    chunks=relevant_chunks,
    query_context=user_query,
    business_rules=safety_policies
)
```

### **Phase 2: Augmentation - Context Enhancement**
```python
# Step 4: Enrich context with business rules
augmented_context = context_enricher.augment(
    retrieved_knowledge=filtered_knowledge,
    business_rules=api_over_db_policy,
    safety_guardrails=operational_safety_rules,
    user_permissions=user_context.roles,
    environment_metadata={'env': target_env, 'risk_level': env_risk}
)

# Step 5: Apply risk assessment
risk_assessment = risk_engine.evaluate(
    task_type=classification.task_id,
    context=augmented_context,
    environment=target_env,
    user_context=user_info
)
```

### **Phase 3: Generation - LLM Reasoning**
```python
# Step 6: LLM reasoning with retrieved context
reasoning_prompt = prompt_builder.build_contextual_prompt(
    query=user_query,
    classification=pattern_result,
    retrieved_knowledge=filtered_knowledge,
    augmented_context=augmented_context,
    task_template=use_case_template
)

# Step 7: Generate citation-backed response
response = claude_client.generate_with_reasoning(
    prompt=reasoning_prompt,
    max_tokens=2000,
    temperature=0.1,  # Low temperature for operational safety
    system_instructions=safety_guidelines
)

# Step 8: Post-process and validate
final_response = response_validator.validate_and_cite(
    llm_response=response,
    source_citations=filtered_knowledge.sources,
    safety_checks=operational_guardrails
)
```

### **Trust and Safety Layer**
```python
# Citation validation
citations = citation_manager.validate_sources(
    response=final_response,
    original_sources=filtered_knowledge,
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)

# Safety guardrails
safety_check = safety_validator.verify_recommendations(
    response=final_response,
    business_rules=company_policies,
    risk_assessment=risk_assessment
)

if risk_assessment.requires_approval():
    return approval_manager.route_for_approval(
        request=final_response,
        approvers=risk_assessment.required_approvers
    )
```

## 🎯 **Why RAG is Critical for Operational Intelligence**

### **Trust and Reliability**
RAG transforms OpsGuide from a pattern-matching tool into a **trustworthy operational intelligence system**:
- **Citation-Backed Responses**: Every suggestion is grounded in your actual documentation
- **No Hallucination**: LLM reasoning is constrained by retrieved knowledge
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability from query to source documents

### **Contextual Understanding**
- **For Incidents (U1)**: RAG ensures "next safe action" suggestions are based on actual runbooks and past incident learnings, not generic troubleshooting
- **For Operational Asks (U2)**: RAG retrieves your specific API documentation and procedures, enforcing "API-over-DB" principle with actual endpoint specifications  
- **For Business Queries (U3)**: RAG pulls from your design docs and PRDs to explain workflows with your actual system documentation

### **Dynamic Intelligence**
RAG transforms your **static documentation into dynamic, contextual incident response intelligence**:
- Real-time knowledge synthesis across multiple sources
- Context-aware recommendations based on environment, service, and user permissions
- Continuous learning from new documentation and incident patterns

This architecture demonstrates how to build **cost-conscious RAG systems** that deliver excellent results through pattern matching while providing a clear path to LLM-powered reasoning when business needs justify the additional costs.
